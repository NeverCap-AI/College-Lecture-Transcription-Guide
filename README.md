## 📧 Email Templates

### Template 1: General Permission Request
```
Subject: Recording Request for [Course Name & Number]

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am currently enrolled in your 
[Course Name] class ([Section Number], [Day/Time]).

I am writing to request permission to audio record lectures for 
personal study purposes. I find that reviewing recordings helps me 
better understand complex concepts and prepare for exams.

I want to assure you that:
- Recordings will be used solely for my personal academic use
- I will not share recordings with anyone outside the class
- I will delete all recordings at the end of the semester
- I understand this does not replace class attendance

If you have any concerns or would prefer to discuss alternative 
accommodations, I would be happy to meet during your office hours.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Student ID]
```
